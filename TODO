JIRA needs to work with cloud jira...
  - need vault to pull down the srv-techops-auto user/token to talk to cloud jira

Still to do:
 DONE - print what you are logging into before login prompt
 DONE - Slack notifications/requests for approvals
 DONE - pre-req function to check for external dependencies
 MORE TESTING (DONE?) - Downtime add for stack
 DONE -- Legacy JIRA
 WAIT -- Cloud JIRA
 
 - better logging?
  --- how to get logs into skynet?

 - MORE testing

 Compile the code??
  -- pyinstaller scriptname.py --onefile --clean -n name_of_exe
  -- no need to extra requirements or modules from python.
  -- slow to start the run
  -- large file (15MB for kv-migrator.py so far)

----------------------------------------

we have a working version!
Features:
 - communicates with CO2
   - gets stack info
   - checks for pending changes
   - commits changes
   - waits for approval
 - connectivity checks to instances
 - runs puppet
 - polls logs for current status
 - rollback ability
   - by flag
   - by failure status


----------------------------------------

talk to Devs about restarts required? 
 - definitely need for backout after it was migrated.
 - probably need for new migrations?
 - If restart is needed... set MW for puppet to make this change

talk to Devs about .kvstore_external_migrated cleanup on rollback.
 - causes problems if it lingers, at the next attempt.

--- during migration failure: 2 feature flags to update auto_migrate, and external_kvstore
--- separate runbook for post-migration rollback.
  --- https://confluence.splunk.com/display/CLOUDOPS/Migrate+Data+from+KVService+to+Internal+KVStore

talk to devs about the environment value in platform settings.
 - {stack}.api.scs.splunk.com to be used in near future?

--- {stack}.api.scs.splunk.com is correct...

kvstore migration dashboard to include timestamps for the success/failure events... or only looks at the latest per stack.
 -- corrected and screenshot shown in slack.
